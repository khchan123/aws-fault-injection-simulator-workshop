# AWS Fault Injection Simulator workshop

This is the source repo for both code and instructions for the [AWS chaos engineering workshop](https://chaos-engineering.workshop.aws/). 

## I want to do the workshop hands-on in my own account

Start from the [workshop site](https://chaos-engineering.workshop.aws/). It will guide you through setting up an AWS account, cloning this repo and learning more about chaos engineering.

## I am an Amazon employee preparing to run this workshop for customers
